## 🔎How to set up this project:
🔎How to set up this project:
1.	Clone repository to your machine, in a directory of your choice (you can do this through github or Command Line Interface)

2.	Locate project in Command Line interface, like example below:

*cd /Users/burhan/Desktop/FAC/Wk3/week-3-project-daabest*

3.	Then type *npm i* (this installs the package manager, which also includes packages which are used for testing);

4.	In command Line type *npm test* to run tests on the whiteSpaceFunc(). 

5.	To see Dipict in action, either open the index.html file using your browser or see it on githubpages:

## 🔭Overview:
Dipict is a web app that lets the user search for a word and provides a dictionary definition and pictures (gifs) of it.

### 🔨Built with: 
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
### 📚APIs we used: 
- Giphy API
- Wikipedia API

## 🗺User Journey:
![user journey](https://i.ibb.co/jrj9t59/IMG-4262.jpg)

## 🚦Our workflow:
1. Brainstorming and initial ideas for the project
2. Set up the project and organize the files 
3. Researched APIs, documentation and keys
4. Planned the User Journey
5. API calls (split between two pairs)
6. Wrote our tests and function for user queries
7. Organised JavaScript
8. Styling

## 🎯Our Goals:
- well-structured project architecture
- dynamic website featuring content generated with two APIs
- mobile-first design
- accessible 
- small, pure and tested JS functions

### 🎳Streach Goals:
- refine the design (e.g. standardise gif containers (not actual containers, but img's))
- abstraction
- add randomise button for random wikipedia article and gifs

## 🔓Accessibility:

- Quite a simple website - 45% accessibility at first --> needed to add labels and alt text for img's --> HOW when we don't know what gif are being searched for
- Added aria-label to input field --> 76%, can we do anything with the img's?

## 🚨Problems & what we've learned:
### "I don't see anything to improve here" - Anna B
- Jinxing the project at the very beginning ("This shouldn't be that hard!")
- Finding a good API is not easy, initial APIs required too much authentication (Oxford Dictionary and Pexels).
#### The tiny things

- IIFE
- The order in which you call scripts in the index.html matters
- General git shenanigans
