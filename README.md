## 🚦Our workflow:
1. Brainstorming and initial ideas for the project
2. Set up the project and organize the files 
3. Researched APIs, documentation and keys
4. Planned the User Journey
5. API calls (split between two pairs)
6. Wrote our tests and function for user queries
7. Organised JavaScript
8. Styling

## 🎯Our Goals:
- well-structured project architecture
- dynamic website featuring content generated with two APIs
- mobile-first design
- accessible 
- small, pure and tested JS functions

### 🎳Streach Goals:
- refine the design 

## 🔓Accessibility:

## 🚨Problems & what we've learned:
- Finding a good API is not easy, initial APIs required too much authentication (Oxford Dictionary and Pexels).
- The tiny things 
- IIFE
- The order in which you call scripts in the index.html matters
